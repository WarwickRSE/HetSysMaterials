This repo contains the supplementary materials for Warwick's PX913 course, part of
the HetSys CDT.

The Workshops directory contains both code to use in the Workshops and model answers to
some of the tasks. The instructions should make it clear what is what. The model solutions
are not always the *only* correct solution, but are *a* possible approach.

The Assignments directory contains the helper code we provide for the assignments
and after each assignment is due, will contain a model answer. This will not be
the *only* correct solution, but is correct and relatively elegant.

Please do let us know if there are any errors in the code!
